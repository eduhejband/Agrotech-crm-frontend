# AgroTech CRM Frontend

AgroTech CRM Frontend is a frontend MVP developed to support the AgroTech CRM backend in an agriculture-focused system.

The project was built to enable basic user interaction and business flow validation, prioritizing functionality and backend integration.

This frontend serves as a complementary layer to the system and is not intended to showcase frontend specialization, but rather to support a real-world MVP delivery.
